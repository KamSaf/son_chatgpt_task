I've chosen ChatGPT for the task, because it's really easy to access and use and he is pretty good at many basic tasks (sometimes also more advanced).

The task gave to ChatGPT was creating a summary of a scientific article, on the basis of which he was then supposed to create a chapter of diploma thesis.

The results, which were translated into Polish by DeepL, are included in chat_output.txt file in repository.


The main advantage of ChatGPT are, as I previously said, that it is really easy to access and use. It gives broad range of possibilities and copes with the tasks pretty well.

However, it is also one of its main disadvantages. As with most of universal tools, it kind of falls apart with very specific problems, which other, more specialized, softwares will handle with no problems.
